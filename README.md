# NuCamp App

The project is complete, the only thing preventing me from deploying is that the data needs to be moved to a different server, currently the app fetches the data from a local JSON server.
## To run the project:
In the project directory, execute:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
